Q1. What is the main role of the linker script? 
The linker script designates the location and permissions of various segments of memory for the firmware to
later make use of.

Q2. What does the ENTRY command in the linker script do?
The ENTRY command specifies where the program will begin executing.

Q3. Where in the STM memory map are the three ELF segments placed (i.e. flash, sram, system memory)?
From given linker file:
Flash starts at 0x08000000, SRAM starts at 0x20000000, and System Memory is at 0x60000000.
From STM32F103CB PDF memory map:
SRAM starts at 0x200007D0 ends at 0x20000000
Flash starts at 0x0801 FFFF and ends at 0x0800 0000
System Memory starts at 0x1FFF F800 and ends at 0x1FFF F000

Q4. What role does the startup file (startup_stm32f10x_md.s) play?

Q5. Can you get the red LED to flash? Why is this harder? This is a good example of some of the challenges you will face with embedded devices and why the reference manual/STM-examples are key.
